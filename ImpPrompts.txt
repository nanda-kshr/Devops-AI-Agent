1) go to my account and create a docker file for my repo by going through all requirements and files yourself

2) Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that triggers on a push to the main branch. The workflow should:
Build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub, using DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PAT stored in GitHub Secrets (already configured).
Use the already-configured SERVICE_ACCOUNT GitHub secret to authenticate with Google Cloud.
Use two additional secrets: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_GCP_ZONE for the GCP project ID and zone, respectively.
Assume the Google Cloud instance named heavy-server is already running â€” do not include logic to start it.
SSH into the instance with gcp user and run all required Docker commands (delete existing image, pull latest image, stop and remove running container, and run a new container) in a single-line command string to avoid multi-line errors with gcloud compute ssh.
When running the new Docker container stop or remove any container with the same name before running, bind the container to port 3000. also i have logs in /logs/app.log
Dont make the workflow file complex.
**Remember** all are in secrets
