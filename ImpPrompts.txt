1) Analyze the GitHub repository 'nanda-kshr/instaroid' including all source files, dependencies, and requirements. Based on your analysis, create an optimized Dockerfile that:
    - Uses appropriate base image for the project's technology stack
    - Installs all necessary dependencies
    - Configures the runtime environment
    - Follows Docker best practices (multi-stage builds, layer optimization, security)
    - Includes proper WORKDIR, COPY, and CMD instructions
    - Handles any build-time requirements or environment variables

2) Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that triggers on a push to the main branch. The workflow should:
Build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub, using DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PAT stored in GitHub Secrets (already configured).
Use the already-configured SERVICE_ACCOUNT GitHub secret to authenticate with Google Cloud.
Use two additional secrets: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_GCP_ZONE for the GCP project ID and zone, respectively.
Assume the Google Cloud instance named heavy-server is already running â€” do not include logic to start it.
SSH into the instance with gcp user and run all required Docker commands (delete existing image, pull latest image, stop and remove running container, and run a new container) in a single-line command string to avoid multi-line errors with gcloud compute ssh.
When running the new Docker container, bind the container to a random port between 3000 and 5000 as common ports might already being used, reduce the chance of getting a port which is already binded.

**Remember** all are in secrets
