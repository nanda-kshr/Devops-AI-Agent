# Autonomous DevOps Agent with Genkit + MCP (Go)

## Overview

This project is a fully autonomous DevOps agent built using Go, Genkit, and MCP (Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol) designed to revolutionize the software delivery lifecycle. It addresses the critical challenges faced by development teams today: complex deployment pipelines, inconsistent environments, and the DevOps talent shortage. By automating the entire DevOps lifecycle—from code review and testing to infrastructure provisioning and production deployment—based on a single prompt or configuration,  it enables teams to ship high-quality software faster and with fewer resources.
 
The primary motivation behind this project is to democratize DevOps expertise, making enterprise-grade deployment practices accessible to teams of all sizes and technical backgrounds. By codifying DevOps best practices into an intelligent agent system, we eliminate the need for specialized expertise while maintaining (or improving) the quality of deployments.  
  
The system leverages Genkit for AI-based decisions (e.g., code review, security analysis, Terraform generation), and orchestrates a series of specialized agents through MCP to complete tasks such as CI/CD, monitoring setup, and reverse proxy configuration. This multi-agent approach ensures each component is optimized for its specific task while maintaining seamless communication through the MCP protocol.

## Architecture

[User Prompt / Config]
↓
[Web Dashboard]
↓
[DevOps Orchestrator Agent] - Central coordinator using MCP protocol
↓
┌────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│ CodeReview │ TestRunner │ BuildAgent │ InfraAgent │ - Specialized tier-1 agents
└────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
↓ ↓ ↓
DeployAgent → MonitoringAgent → NGINXAgent - Sequential tier-2 agents

The architecture follows a hierarchical pattern where:
1. The DevOps Orchestrator receives user intents via the dashboard
2. It creates a complete execution plan and breaks it into discrete tasks
3. Tier-1 agents work in parallel on independent subsystems
4. Tier-2 agents handle sequential tasks that depend on earlier outputs
5. All communication happens via MCP with structured task definitions
6. Each agent can spawn sub-tasks when needed, maintaining complete observability

### Core Technologies

- **Language:** Golang (chosen for performance, concurrency model, and cloud-native ecosystem)
- **LLM Integration:** Genkit + Ollama (Gemma, LLaMA, Claude, etc.) with the ability to run locally or connect to hosted API endpoints
- **MCP Orchestration:** Redis/Kafka task queue with guaranteed delivery and failure handling
- **Build Tools:** Docker with BuildKit for efficient, reproducible builds
- **IaC:** Terraform, GCP CLI with state management and version control integration
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with custom action development and workflow orchestration
- **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GKE, Cloud Run) with cost optimization and auto-scaling
- **Monitoring:** Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager with custom dashboards and alert routing
- **Reverse Proxy:** NGINX with performance tuning and security hardening
- **Secrets:** Vault, GCP Secret Manager with encryption and access controls
- **UI/UX:** Web dashboard with real-time progress tracking, log visualization, and metric reporting

## How It Works

1. **User Interface**:
   A web-based dashboard allows the user to input:
   - Git repository URL or integration with GitHub/GitLab accounts
   - Deployment environment (dev, staging, production) with environment-specific configurations
   - Infrastructure preferences (Terraform or GCP CLI) and resource constraints/budgets
   - Monitoring and proxy configurations including custom metrics and alerting thresholds
   - Compliance requirements and security policies to enforce
   - Deployment strategy (blue/green, canary, rolling) with customizable parameters

   The dashboard provides templates for common application types (web app, API service, data processing) to streamline configuration.

2. **Single Button Execution**:
   Once configured, the user can click a button to trigger the full pipeline. Behind the scenes:
   - A top-level DevOps Orchestrator Agent is activated and creates an execution plan
   - It performs initial validation of inputs and authentication with required services
   - It dispatches tasks to appropriate agents via MCP with priority and dependency information
   - Each agent performs its task, reports status, and triggers dependent tasks
   - Comprehensive logging occurs at each step for auditability
   - Failure handling includes automatic retries, fallback strategies, and user notification

3. **Progress Visualization**:
   The web dashboard displays real-time progress of each task:
   - Code review comments with severity levels and automatic fix suggestions
   - Test results with coverage metrics and performance comparisons to previous runs
   - Build logs with timing information and resource utilization
   - Terraform apply outputs with cost estimates and security compliance checks
   - Deployment URLs with health check status and performance metrics
   - Monitoring dashboards and metrics with anomaly detection and trend analysis
   - Time estimates for remaining tasks and bottleneck identification

## Use Cases and Benefits

1. **For Startups and Small Teams:**
   - Deploy production-quality infrastructure without dedicated DevOps engineers
   - Implement security best practices automatically
   - Reduce time-to-market for new features
   - Achieve enterprise-grade deployment practices on a startup budget

2. **For Enterprise Organizations:**
   - Standardize deployment practices across multiple teams
   - Enforce compliance and security policies automatically
   - Reduce operational overhead and human error
   - Free up specialized DevOps personnel for strategic initiatives

3. **For Individual Developers:**
   - Learn DevOps best practices through observable automation
   - Deploy side projects with professional-grade infrastructure
   - Experiment with different cloud configurations without expertise
   - Focus on application development rather than operational concerns

## Recommended Usage Format

This project is best showcased as a **web-based dashboard** rather than a pure CLI tool, though both interfaces are supported for different use cases.

### Why a Website?

- Enables end-to-end observability of all tasks in one place with intuitive visualizations
- Makes configuration management more accessible through form-based inputs and validation
- Allows non-technical users (e.g., QA, product managers, stakeholders) to initiate full deployments
- Better UX for live logs, graphs, and test coverage visualization with filtering capabilities
- Facilitates team collaboration through shared deployment history and configuration templates
- Provides educational value through transparent process visualization and documentation

## Execution Flow

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Clone or connect your Git repository through OAuth integration
   - Automatic repository analysis to detect language, framework, and dependencies

3. **Execution:**
   - Click "Run Full DevOps Pipeline" to initiate the process
   - Optionally schedule recurring deployments or trigger on Git events

4. **Real-time Monitoring:**
   - Watch the pipeline stages execute in real-time with detailed status updates:
     - Code review (security vulnerabilities, best practices, optimization opportunities)
     - Test execution (coverage reports, performance benchmarks, regression analysis)
     - Build and artifact push (size optimization, vulnerability scanning, signing)
     - Infrastructure provisioning (cost estimation, compliance validation, drift detection)
     - Production deployment (health checks, traffic shifting, rollback readiness)
     - Monitoring setup (dashboard creation, alert configuration, baseline establishment)

5. **Results and Outputs:**
   - Deployed application URL with SSL certificate status
   - Monitoring dashboards with pre-configured alerts
   - GitHub PR reviews and test results with detailed explanations
   - Complete audit log of all actions taken
